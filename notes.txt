Notes
-----

# figure out boot_command values
## may need to use kickstart
# make sure you're using nat instead of boot
# move appropriate values to variables section; like [ headless, disk_size, cpu, memory ]
# nice makefile build tool to manage packer build: see https://github.com/boxcutter/centos
# use sha256 instead of md5
